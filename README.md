# SimpleToolbarsForms #

The aim of this project is to show how to implement `Xamarin.Forms.ToolbarItem` in cross-platform mobile development and sharing the most of the code.

## Description ##

During the work on some project I couldn't find anything about this in documentation so I decided to make a public repo with simple project for everyone interested in implement such feature in their own projects.
